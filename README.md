# toxiclibs
This is a super convenient github fork of the official toxiclibs repo, for ruby-processing / JRubyArt development work.  Now it will be absolutely clear where credit/blame lies for any changes....
Currently refactoring/reworking for jdk7+ and processing-2.2.1 (in Netbeans)....
Can be build with ant and jdk7+:-
```bash
cd toxiclibs/ant
ant -f build-all.xml
```
Works for me...
